Little bit demo developed in Next.js using its API approach and Dgraph as a native graphql database.

[https://message-board-demo.vercel.app/](https://message-board-demo.vercel.app/)

# Installation Guide

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Install locally

1. Clone the repo

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

3. Create a .env.local file with this format:

`GRAPHQL_API_ENDPOINT=YOUR_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT_URL`

4. Must have a GraphQL server running and accepting this schema:

```
type message {
id: ID!
text: String!
channel: channel @hasInverse(field:messages)
}

type channel {
id: ID!
name: String!
messages: [message]
}
```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
